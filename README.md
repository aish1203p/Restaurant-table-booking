# Deploying-a-wordpress-site-using-EC2

In this project, we will create a wordpress site for a table reservation system.
The site will be developed using Wordpress.
It will be deployed across platforms using AWS EC2
The data generated will be stored in a relational database - SQL Server
This database will be integrated with AWS RDS for scalability and backup purposes.
We will also incorporate the AWS SNS service for sending out SMS notifications to sample customers of our system
